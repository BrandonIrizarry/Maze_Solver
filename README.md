# Maze Solver

This Python 3 program runs an animated graphic of a maze first being
constructed, then being solved.

The maze is constructed using a randomized depth-first search. The
maze is then also solved using depth-first search.

## Instructions

Clone, then execute `main.py` with your locally-installed Python
executable.

## Other Notes

This program was written using Python 3.11.
